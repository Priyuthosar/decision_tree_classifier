Image result for decision tree classifier
Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.

How does decision tree classifier work?


A decision tree is a graphical representation of all possible solutions to a decision based on certain conditions. On each step or node of a decision tree, used for classification, we try to form a condition on the features to separate all the labels or classes contained in the dataset to the fullest purity.
